The AI engineer successfully transformed a ZLECAf trade calculator application. Initially, it performed UI/design overhauls, adopting an African-inspired theme, integrating  for data visualization, and addressing multiple frontend issues like  errors and layout jumps across various sections (preview, country profiles, calculator) by implementing  and stabilizing CSS. Subsequently, the engineer integrated new tax calculations (TVA, other taxes) into the backend using  and updated the  and frontend () to display these. A strategic roadmap was then incorporated, adding new statistical projections and creating a dedicated Outils tab for relevant links. Finally, new data integration was initiated by analyzing user-provided CSV/Excel files to update the Trade Performance tables, specifically correcting intra-African trade data, adding historical years, and making the tables interactive with linked charts, explanations, and dynamic content like Algeria's trade data. The latest task involves integrating newly provided economic data files.

<product_requirements>
The ZLECAf Trade Calculator application, initially a basic MVP, requires significant enhancements. The core problem is to provide users with accurate trade calculations, comprehensive data visualization, and strategic insights into the African Continental Free Trade Area.

**Implemented features include:**
1.  **UI/Design Improvement**: Modern, professional, African-inspired design with improved colors and layout.
2.  **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Integration of charts and graphs using  for results, statistics, country profiles, and top producers.
3.  **Frontend Stability Fixes**: Resolution of preview jump issues,  loop errors, and calculator layout instability.
4.  **Tax Integration**: Incorporation of TVA, customs duties (DD), and other taxes into tariff calculations, based on provided Excel/CSV data.
5.  **Strategic Data & Modules**: Display of AfCFTA strategic projections (macro gains, intra-African exports), a new Outils tab for links to NTB platforms, digital protocol, and GTI.
6.  **Interactive Trade Performance**: Development of a Comparisons tab (later merged into Statistics) with interactive tables and charts showing intra-African trade performance, tariff savings, country-specific data, and historical years (2022-2024), explicitly correcting data source to OEC for intra-African trade figures.
7.  **Data Analysis & Integration**: Analysis of user-provided , , ,  for tax data, and recent  for trade statistics.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS for styling, Recharts for data visualization.
-   **Frontend State Management**: React hooks (, ).
-   **API Communication**: Frontend uses , backend uses  prefix.
-   **Environment Variables**: , .
-   **Error Handling**: Debugging  loops, HTML syntax.
-   **Data Processing**: Python for backend logic, data parsing (Excel/CSV).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The core FastAPI backend file. It defines API endpoints (, , ) and handles the logic for data fetching, tariff/tax calculations, and economic statistics.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to include new tax calculations (TVA, other taxes) by importing , updated response models for tax breakdown, and enhanced the  endpoint with new strategic projections.
-   **/app/backend/tax_rates.py**: A newly created Python file to centralize tax rate data for various African countries, including standard TVA, statistical fees, and community levies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created with a dictionary-like structure mapping countries to their respective tax rates and calculation orders.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component orchestrating the application's UI, state, and API interactions. It contains the calculator, results, statistics, country profiles, rules of origin, and navigation tabs.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified for UI redesign (African theme), integrated  for visualization, fixed  issues (applying , ), stabilized calculator layout, incorporated  and , reorganized tabs (merged Comparisons into Statistics, created Outils).
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains custom CSS styles, primarily for the African-inspired theme.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added new styles for calculator buttons, forms, cards, top producers, tabs, and aggressive animation disabling for  elements to fix jump issues.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.js**: The entry point for the React application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added a global fix for  issues, preventing rapid redraw loops.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/OfficialLinksWidget.jsx**: A new React component to display links to official platforms (NTB, Digital Protocol, GTI).
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to centralize and render these strategic links, integrated into the new Outils tab.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/TradeComparison.jsx**: A new React component dedicated to displaying comparative trade data. It includes metric cards, interactive tables, and linked charts for trade performance, tariff economies, and key ZLECAf indicators.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to encapsulate trade comparison logic, implemented data fetching, interactive sorting, CSV export, filters, added Algeria's data, incorporated year selection (2022-2024), clarified data sources for intra-African trade, and linked a column chart to the table.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Contains environment variables for the frontend, notably .
    -   **Changes Made**: None, adheres to the rule of not modifying .
-   **/app/test_result.md**: Stores problem statements, testing data, and communication logs.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated with backend test results and frontend preview screenshots.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Integrate Gold CSV Files**: The user explicitly chose to integrate provided Gold CSV files (, , etc.) into the application. These specific files are not yet provided to the AI, and the AI cannot generate them.
-   **Implement Lyra+ Prompts**: The full Lyra+ prompt template was shared, but the AI cannot execute it to extract data. This is a user responsibility.
-   **Complete New ZIP Analysis and Integration**: The analysis of  is ongoing, and the integration of the identified files into the application is pending.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with analyzing and integrating newly provided data files from a ZIP archive (). The primary goal is to use these files to update the application's data, particularly for the trade performance tables and potentially other economic indicators.

The AI successfully downloaded the ZIP file and performed an LYRA_OPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md

The work is currently in the **data analysis phase** of integrating these new files. The AI has identified one key data source () from the provided archive, but has not yet detailed how this data will be used or started any code modifications for its integration into the backend or frontend. The previous discussion also involved the user providing specific Gold CSV files which are not yet supplied, so this new ZIP might contain some of those, or additional data to be processed. The AI is poised to identify which specific files from the archive are needed and then plan their integration into the application's backend (for processing) and frontend (for display).

<optional_next_step>
Continue analyzing the remaining files within the  to identify all necessary data sources for integration, then propose a plan for their backend and frontend incorporation.
