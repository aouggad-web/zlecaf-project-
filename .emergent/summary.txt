The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the ZLECAf Trade Calculator application. Initially, the project involved integrating new economic data (, ) into the backend (, ) and updating the frontend (, ) for display. Key tasks included fixing numerous UI/data display bugs (blank pages, incorrect rates, static data), improving data visualization (charts, tables), refining UI aesthetics (font sizes, compactness), and correcting data accuracy (Alg√©rie's GDP, distinguishing global vs. intra-African trade). The process involved iterative debugging, particularly for frontend rendering issues and backend CSV parsing errors. The latest interaction centered on verifying and updating country profile data, explicitly requested by the user.

<product_requirements>
The ZLECAf Trade Calculator application aims to provide accurate trade calculations, comprehensive data visualization, and strategic insights for the African Continental Free Trade Area.

**Implemented features include:**
1.  **UI/Design Improvement**: Modern, African-inspired design with improved layouts.
2.  **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Integration of charts/graphs using  for results, statistics, country profiles, and top producers.
3.  **Frontend Stability Fixes**: Resolution of  errors and layout instability.
4.  **Tax Integration**: Incorporation of TVA, customs duties, and other taxes.
5.  **Strategic Data & Modules**: Display of AfCFTA strategic projections and an Outils tab for links.
6.  **Interactive Trade Performance**: Statistics tab with interactive tables and charts for trade performance (global and intra-African), tariff savings, and historical years.
7.  **Data Analysis & Integration**: Integration of new economic data (ZLECAf_Economic_Data_2024.csv, zlecaf_corrections_2024.json) into backend and frontend.
8.  **Refined Country Profiles**: Display of enriched country data including trading partners, trade statistics, and credit ratings.
9.  **Language Support**: Initial steps towards full English translation.

-   **Integrate Gold CSV Files**: The user explicitly chose to integrate provided Gold CSV files (, , etc.). These specific files are not yet provided.
-   **Implement Lyra+ Prompts**: The full Lyra+ prompt template was shared, but the AI cannot execute it to extract data. This is a user responsibility.
-   **Complete Country Profile Data Verification**: The user requested verification and update of country profile data regarding population, ratings, infrastructure (ports, airports, railways), external debt, and energy index.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing data accuracy issues within the application. A significant recent focus was on correcting the GDP data for Algeria in the  file, ensuring it reflected the country's correct ranking (3rd) among African economies according to FMI/World Bank data. This involved several attempts to modify the CSV file using  and direct Python manipulation, leading to repeated CSV parsing errors (e.g., Expected 39 fields in line 3, saw 48 or Expected 39 fields in line 1, saw 43) due to incorrect column counts or header mismatches.

The troubleshoot agent was invoked to identify the root cause, which was confirmed to be a discrepancy between the CSV header's column count (39) and the data rows' column count (43). The AI successfully fixed this by adding 4 generic columns to the header, allowing the CSV to load correctly and backend services to restart.

The last user request (Chat Message 627) is to further verify and update other specific data points within the country profiles, including:
- Population numbers.
- Rating data.
- Infrastructure indicators (ports, airports, railways).
- External debt.
- Energy index.

The AI engineer acknowledged this request and was about to begin the verification process for these country profile data points, starting by checking what is currently displayed. The current state is that the backend is healthy and the CSV parsing issues related to GDP have been resolved, with Algeria's GDP correctly displayed. However, the accuracy of other country profile metrics remains to be confirmed and potentially updated based on the user's latest feedback.
